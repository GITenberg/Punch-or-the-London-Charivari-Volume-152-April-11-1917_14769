    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The question as to how America's army will assist the Allies
    has not yet been decided, so that President WILSON will still
    be glad of suggestions from our halfpenny morning papers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The military absentee who said he had just dined at a London
    restaurant, and therefore did not mind going back to the
    trenches, acted rightly in not disclosing the name of the
    restaurant.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The report that M. VENEZELOS was in London has been denied
    by <i>The Daily Mail</i> and the Press Bureau. It is expected
    that the news will at once be telegraphed to M. VENEZELOS.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is a proposal to shorten theatrical performances, and
    several managers of revue, unable to determine which joke to
    retain, have in desperation resolved to sacrifice both.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Owing to travelling and other difficulties the British
    Association have decided not to hold their annual meeting this
    year. Unofficially, the decision is attributed to the growing
    prejudice against a continuance of the more frivolous forms of
    entertainment.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A soldier in Salonika has asked a friend in Surrey to send
    him some flower seeds for a garden in his camp. We hear that
    Mr. LYNCH, M.P., is convinced that this is merely an inspired
    attempt to obscure the real object of the campaign.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We learn with satisfaction that it is proposed to form a
    Ministry of Health, for many of the Government Departments seem
    to be suffering from a variety of complaints.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In connection with a recent law case, in which a certain Mr.
    SHAW was referred to as "one of the public," we hasten to point
    out that it did not refer to Mr. GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, who, of
    course, is not in that category.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Peanuts," says <i>The Daily Chronicle,</i> "do not seem to
    be receiving the attention they deserve from our food experts."
    Several of our younger readers who profess to be food experts
    declare that they are ready to attend to all the peanuts that
    our contemporary cares to put in their way.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In a duel with revolvers last week two Spanish officers
    wounded one another. We have all along maintained that duels
    with revolvers are becoming positively dangerous.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A cheque for twenty-five million dollars has just been
    handed to M. BRON, Danish Minister at Washington, in payment
    for the Danish West Indies. This, we understand, includes cost
    of packing and delivery.</p>

        <p><i>Master (after the event).</i> "DO YOU KNOW, YOUNG
        MAN, THAT THIS PAINS ME MUCH MORE THAN IT DOES YOU?"</p>

        <p><i>The Terror.</i> "NO, I DIDN'T KNOW, SIR. BUT IF THAT

    <p>There is a serious shortage of margarine and many people
    have been compelled to fall back on butter.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A gossip writer states that one of the recent additions to
    the Metropolitan Special constabulary weighs seventeen stone.
    It is not yet decided whether he will take one beat or two.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is to be no General Election this year for fear that
    it might clash with the other War.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Another military absentee having told the Thames Police
    Court magistrate that he did not know there was a War on, it is
    expected that the Government will have to announce the
    fact.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is no longer the fashion to regard the British as a
    degenerate race. Still it is good to know that one of our rat
    clubs has killed no fewer than three hundred of these ferocious
    beasts.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A contemporary suggests that we may yet institute a system
    of pigeon post, and thus assist the postal services. There will
    be fine mornings when the exasperated house-holder will be
    waiting behind the door with a shot-gun for the bird which
    attempts to deliver the Income Tax papers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Two litigants in the Bombay High Court have settled their
    differences by agreeing that the sum in dispute shall be paid
    into the War Fund. This is considered to be a marked
    improvement on the old method of dividing it between the
    lawyers in the case.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"It is my supreme war aim," said Count VON ROON in the
    Prussian House of Lords, "to keep the Throne and the Dynasty
    sky high." Once we have knocked them sky high the Count can
    keep them in any old place he likes.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At a recent concert at Cripplegate Institute in aid of St.
    Dunstan's Hostel for Blinded Soldiers, lightning sketches of
    cats by Louis WAIN were sold by auction. The sketching of these
    night-prowlers by lightning is, we understand, a most
    exhilarating pursuit, but the opportunities for it are
    comparatively rare, and most artists have to utilise the moon
    or the searchlight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is announced that owing to the shortage of paper the
    number of propagandist pamphlets published by the German
    Government will be diminished. The decision may also have been
    influenced by the increasing shortage of neutrals.</p>

    <h2>BLANCHE'S LETTERS.</h2>

    <p class="center">SOCIETY "WAR-WORKERS."</p>

    <p>DEAREST DAPHNE,&mdash;The scarcity of paper isn't altogether
    an unmixed misfortune, as far as one's correspondence is
    concerned. Letters that don't matter, letters from the
    insignificant and the boresome, simply aren't answered. For
    small spur-of-the-moment notes to one's <i>intimes</i> who're
    not too far off, there's quite a little feeling for using
    <i>slates</i>. One writes what one's to say on one's slate
    (which may be just as dilly a little affair as you please, with
    plain or chased silver frame, enamelled monogram or coronet,
    and pencil hanging by a little silver chain), and sends it by a
    servant. When the note's been read, it's wiped off, the answer
    written, and the slate brought back. <i>Isn't</i> that
    fragrant? I may claim to have set this fashion. Of course a
    very <i>voyant</i> slate is not just-so. The
    Bullyon-Boundermere woman set up one with a deep,
    heavily-chased gold frame, and "B.-B." at the top set with big
    diamonds. <i>C'est bien elle!</i> She'd used it only
    half-a-dozen times when it was snatched from her footwoman, who
    was taking it to somebody's house, and hasn't been heard of
    since!</p>

    <p><i>People Who Matter</i> gave a double-page to illustrating
    "War-Time Correspondence Slates of Social Leaders." <i>My</i>
    slate's there, and Stella Clackmannan's, and Beryl's and
    several more. &Agrave; propos, have you seen the series of
    "Well-known War-Workers" they've been having lately in
    <i>People Who Matter</i>? They're really quite worth while.
    There's dear Lala Middleshire in one of those charming "Olga"
    trench coats (khaki face-cloth lined self-coloured satin and
    with big, lovely, gilt-and-enamelled buttons), high brown
    boots, and one of those saucy little Belgian caps with a
    distracting little tassel wagging in front. The pickie is
    called "The Duchess of Middleshire Takes a War-Worker's Lunch,"
    and dear Lala is shown standing by a table, looking so
    <i>bravely</i> at two cutlets, a potato, a piece of war bread,
    a piece of war cheese and a small pudding.</p>

    <p>Then there's Hermione Shropshire, in a perfectly
    <i>haunting</i> lace and taffetas morning robe, with a clock
    near her (marked with a cross) pointing to eight o'clock! (She
    lets her maid dress her at that hour now, so that the girl may
    go and make munitions.) And Edelfleda Saxonbury is shown in an
    evening gown, wearing her famous pearls. She's leaning her chin
    on her hand and gazing with a sweet wistful look at an inset
    view of the hostel where she's washed plates and cups quite
    several times.</p>

    <p>And last but not least there's a pickie that the journalist
    people have dubbed, "Distinguished Society Women distinguish
    themselves as Carpenters," <i>et voil&agrave;</i> Beryl, Babs
    and your Blanche, in delicious cream serge overall things, with
    hammers, planes, and saws embroidered in crewels on the big
    square collars and turn-up cuffs, and enormously becoming
    carpenter's caps, looking at a rest-hut we've just finished.
    Oh, my dearest and best, you don't know what it is to
    <i>live</i> till you've learned to <i>carpent</i>! It's
    positively <i>enthralling</i>! When we're skilful enough we're
    to go abroad&mdash;<i>mais il faut se taire</i>! <i>I</i> don't
    see why we shouldn't go <i>now</i>. We're as skilful as we
    shall ever be. And even if one or two of our huts <i>had</i> no
    doors what's that matter? Besides, a hut with no door has a
    tremendous pull&mdash;there wouldn't be any draughts!</p>

    <p>Everyone's <i>furious</i> at the way the powers that be have
    treated Sybil Easthampton. You know what a wonderful thing her
    Ollyoola Love Dance is. Of course she's lived among the
    Ollyoolas and knows them in all their moods. (They're natives
    somewhere ever and ever so far off, where there are palms and
    coral reefs, and the people don't believe in wrapping
    themselves up much.) And so she's given the dance at a great
    many War Fund matinees. That little Mrs. Jimmy Sharpe, daring
    to criticise it, said there was too much Ollyoola and not
    enough dance; but everybody who <i>counts</i> simply raves
    about it. And then, when some manager person offered Sybil big
    terms to do it at the "Incandescent," he was "officially
    informed" that, if the Ollyoola Love Dance went into the bill
    the "Incandescent" would be "placed out of bounds"! What do
    you, <i>do</i> you think of that, <i>m'amie</i>? A piece of
    sheer <i>artistry</i> like the Ollyoola Love Dance to be
    treated so! And it's wonderful not only artistically but
    scientifically. Each of dear Sybil's amazing wriggles and
    squirms and crouches and springs is <i>absolutely</i>
    true&mdash;<i>exactly</i> what an Ollyoola <i>does</i> when
    it's in love.</p>

    <p>We're all glad to think we can <i>still</i> see the Ollyoola
    Love Dance at War Fund matin&eacute;es.</p>

    <h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

    <p class="center">LIX.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Reference the German withdrawal. The
    matter is proceeding in machine-like order, and one of the
    first great men to cross No-Man's Land was myself in the
    noblest of cars. It was, I confess, a purely temporary and
    fortuitous arrangement which put me in such a conveyance, but I
    had the feeling that it was excellently fitted to my particular
    form of greatness, and there were moments when I was so
    enamoured of it that I was on the verge of getting into a hole
    with it and staying hid there till the end of the War. Just the
    right hole was provided at every cross-roads, but the driver
    wouldn't try them and went round by the fields.</p>

    <p>Of the flattened villages and the severed fruit-trees you
    will have read as much as I have seen. It's a gruesome
    business, but one charred village is much like another, and the
    sight is, alas, a familiar one nowadays. For me all else was
    forgotten in speechless admiration of the French people. Their
    self-restraint and adaptability are beyond words. These
    hundreds of honest people, just relieved from the domineering
    of the Master Swine and restored to their own good France
    again, were neither hysterical nor exhausted. They were just
    their happy selves, very pleased about it all, standing in
    their doorways, strolling about the market-place, watching the
    march of events as one might watch a play. Every house had its
    tricolor bravely flying; where they'd got them from so soon I
    don't know, but no Frenchman ever yet failed, under any
    circumstances, to produce exactly the right thing at exactly
    the right moment. There was a nice old Adjoint at the Mairie
    who wasn't for doing any business at all, with the English or
    anyone else, until a certain formality had been observed. He
    had a bottle of old brandy in his cellar, which somehow or
    other had escaped the German eye these last two years. This,
    said Monsieur, had first to be disposed of before any other
    business could conceivably be entertained ... I gathered he had
    risked much, everything possibly, in keeping this bottle two
    years; but nothing on earth would induce him to retain it two
    minutes longer.</p>

    <p>Madame, the doctor's wife, approached me as a friend with a
    request. Would I expedite a letter to her people, to announce
    her restoration to liberty? I was at Madame's disposal. She
    handed me the letter. I observed that the envelope was not
    closed down. Madame's look indicated that this was intentional,
    and her expression indicated that this was the sort of thing
    she was used to.</p>

    <p>There was no weeping, no extreme emotion. There was a
    philosophical detachment, a very prevalent humour, and, for the
    rest, signs of a quiet waiting for "The Day." There is only one
    day for France, the day of the arrival of Frenchmen on German
    soil. When the English arrive in Germany there will be nothing
    doing, except some short and precise orders that we must salute
    all civilians and pay double for what we buy; but when the
    French arrive in Germany ... and Heaven send we are going to
    help them to get well in!</p>

    <p>There is a story current, turning on these events, of a
    young German officer and an official correspondence. It just
    possibly may be true, since even among such a rotten lot there
    might conceivably have been one tolerable fellow. The Higher
    Command had been much intrigued as to a church window, wanting
    to know (in writing) exactly why and how it had been broken; or
    rather, as it was the German Higher Command, exactly why and
    how it had been allowed to remain unbroken. You know how these
    affairs develop in interest and excitement as the
    correspondence passes down and down, from one formation to
    another, and what an air of urgency and bitterness they wear
    when they reach the last man. In this case the young German
    subaltern, who had no one else below him on whom to put the
    burden of explaining in writing, took advantage of his
    position, and wrote upon a slip, which he attached to the top
    of the others: "To Officer Commanding British Troops. Passed to
    you, please, as this town is now in your area...."</p>

    <p>Probably the tale isn't true, for if the officer was a
    German he must have had German blood in him, and if he had
    German blood in him there couldn't be room for anything else,
    certainly not for a sense of humour.</p>

    <p>We stayed longer than we should have done; this was an
    occasion upon which one could not insist on the limit of ten
    handshakes per person. I was delayed also by the Institutrice,
    who wanted to borrow my uniform, so that she might put it on
    and so be in a position to start right off at once, paying
    back. She meant it too, and I should not be surprised to hear
    that she's been caught doing it by this time. Her mother was
    there in great form. Asked for her opinion of the dear
    departed, she said she had already told it to themselves and
    saw no reason to alter it. "They make war only on women and
    children; they are <i>l&acirc;ches</i>." My N.C.O. got out his
    pocket-dictionary to discover the exact meaning of the word.
    She told us he needn't trouble; it meant two months'
    imprisonment. She had a face like a russet apple&mdash;a very
    nice russet apple, too.</p>

    <p>We didn't get away before dark, and we found it very hard to
    discover our way about new country when large hunks of it were
    missing altogether. One of the party would walk on to find the
    way, and later I would go forth to find him. We could see the
    road stretching away in front of us for kilometres; but between
    us and it there would be twenty yards of nil.</p>

    <p>However, the car eventually learnt to stand on its back
    wheels, climb hedges and make its way home across country,
    having confirmed its general opinion of the Bosch, that he is
    only good at one thing, and that is destroying other people's
    property. I am now back in comfort again, and able to remember
    your suffering. I send herewith a slice of bully beef (one) and
    potatoes (two), hoping that they will not be torpedoed, and
    urging you to hang on, for we are now beginning to think of
    moving towards Germany, if only to see, when we get there,
    exactly what the Frenchman has been evolving in his mind all
    this time.</p>

    <p><i>Janet</i> (<i>as before</i>). He's had a play taken by

    There'll be a play about me&mdash;about us, this
    house&mdash;everything. But (<i>passionately</i>) I'll thwart
    him yet. Janet, my girl, do thee write at once and say that I
    withdraw my opposition to the engagement.</p>

    <p><i>Janet</i> (<i>dully</i>). But I don't want the man.</p>

    <p><i>Bully</i>, (<i>hectoring</i>). Am I your feyther or am I
    not? I tell you you shall marry him. And what's more, he shan't
    find us what he looks for. No, no (<i>with rising
    agitation</i>), he thinks that because I'm a town councillor
    I'm to be made game of, does he? Well, I'll learn him
    different! (<i>Glaring round</i>) This room&mdash;it's got to

    belong to a night-club before the week's out. (<i>He does his
    glare again.</i>) I'll establish frivolity and a spirit of

    <h3>THE WOBBLER.</h3>

    <p>My friend, whom for the purpose of concealing his identity I
    will call Wiggles, opened fire upon me on March 1st (coming in
    like a lion) with this:</p>

    <p>"DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;I have not been well and my doctor
    thinks it might do me good to come to Cornwall for a few weeks.
    May I invite myself to stay with you?..."</p>

    <p>I accepted his invitation, if I may put it so, and on March
    6th received the following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;I am not, as I think I said, at all
    well, and my doctor considers I had better break the journey at
    Plymouth, as it is a long way from Malvern to Cornwall. Would
    you recommend me some hotels to choose from? I hope to start by
    the middle of the month ..."</p>

    <p>I recommended hotels, and on the 12th heard from him
    again:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;I am very obliged to you. In this
    severe weather my doctor says that I cannot be too careful, and
    I doubt if I shall be able to start for ten days or so. Has
    your house a south aspect, and is it far from the sea? I
    require air but not wind. And could you tell me ..."</p>

    <p>I told him all right, though as a guest I began to think him
    a little <i>exigeant</i>. But he was unwell.</p>

    <p>On the 17th he answered me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;I understand you live <i>quite</i> in
    the country. Would you tell me whether a doctor lives near to
    you and whether you have a chemist within reasonable distance?
    My doctor, who really understands my case, won't hear of my
    starting until the wind changes: but I hope ..."</p>

    <p>I drew a map showing my house, the nearest chemist's shop,
    the doctor's surgery and a few other points of interest, such
    as Land's End and the Lizard. This I sent to him, and on the
    22nd he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;I acknowledge your map with many
    thanks. There is one more thing. My doctor insists on a very
    special diet. Can your cook make porridge? I rely very largely
    on porridge for breakfast and ..."</p>

    <p>I saw myself smiling at Lord DEVONPORT and wired back, "Have
    you ever known a cook who couldn't make porridge?"</p>

    <p>And on the 27th he issued his ultimatum:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;I have consulted my doctor and he
    thinks I ought not to tempt Providence by travelling at
    present, so I have decided to remain in Malvern. I do hope
    ..."</p>

    <p>To this I replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DEAR WIGGLES,&mdash;Holding as you do the old pagan view of
    Providence, you are quite right not to tempt it. The loss is
    mine. I hope you will soon be rather less unwell."</p>

    <p>Then I went away for three days without leaving an address,
    and when I returned it was to learn that Wiggles had arrived on
    the previous evening. And in my study I found him, together
    with four wires (two to say he wasn't coming and two to say he
    was) and a table loaded with prescriptions.</p>

    <p>He eats enormously.</p>

    <p class="center">THE CAT AND THE KING.</p>

    <p>The cat looked at the King.</p>

    <p>She was the boldest cat in the world, but her heart stood
    still as she vindicated the immemorial right of her race.</p>

    <p>What would the King say? What would the King do?</p>

    <p>Would he call her up to sit on his royal shoulder? If so,
    she would purr her loudest to drown the beating of her heart,
    and she would rub her head against the royal ear. How splendid
    to be a royal cat!</p>

    <p>Or perhaps he would appoint her Mouser to the King's
    Household, and she would keep the King's peace with tooth and
    claw.</p>

    <p>Or perhaps she would become playmate to the Royal children,
    and live on cream and sleep all day on a silken cushion.</p>

    <p>Or&mdash;and this is where her heart ceased to
    beat&mdash;perhaps she would pay the price of her temerity and
    the Hereditary Executioner would smite off her head.</p>

    <p>She had put it boldly to the test, to sink or swim. What
    would the King do?</p>

    <p>The King rose slowly from his throne and passed out to his
    own apartments, whilst all the Court bowed.</p>

    <p>The King had not noticed the cat.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, April 2nd</i>.&mdash;The MINISTER OF MUNITIONS
    informed the House that, owing to the demand for explosives,
    there is a shortage of acid for artificial fertilisers. It is
    rumoured that Mr. SNOWDEN, Mr. OUTHWAITE and Mr. PRINGLE,
    feeling that it is up to them to do something useful for their
    country, have placed at Dr. ADDISON'S disposal a selection from
    the speeches delivered by them during the War, containing an
    abundant supply of the necessary commodity.</p>

    <p>Mr. JOSEPH MARTIN has all the migratory instincts of his
    well-known family, and flits from East St. Pancras to British
    Columbia and back again with engaging irregularity. On his rare
    visits to Westminster he is always ready to impart in a
    somewhat strident voice (another family characteristic) the
    political wisdom that he has garnered from the New World and
    the Old. But somehow the House fails to take him at his own
    valuation, and when he tried to belittle the Imperial
    Conference, on the ground that the Dominion Premier and his
    colleagues would be much better employed at home, I think there
    was a general feeling that the physician would be none the
    worse for a dose of his own prescription.</p>

    <p>Cheers greeted little Mr. STEPHEN WALSH as he stepped to the
    Table to give his first answer as Parliamentary Secretary to
    the Ministry of National Service. There were more cheers (in
    which, had etiquette permitted, the Press Gallery would have
    liked to join) when it was found that the new Minister needed
    no megaphone, every word being audible all over the House. And
    when finally he gave Mr. PRINGLE a much-needed corrective, by
    telling him that if he wanted further information he must put a
    Question down, the House cheered again. So far as a single
    incident enables one to judge, another representative of Labour
    has "made good."</p>

    <p>Viscount VALENTIA has gone to the Lords, and the Commons
    will henceforth miss the elegant and well-groomed figure which
    lent distinction to a Treasury Bench not in these days too
    careful of the Graces. Happily Oxford City has found another
    distinguished man to succeed him. Mr. J.A.R. MARRIOTT may
    indeed be said to have obtained a Parliamentary reputation even
    before, strictly speaking, he was a Member. Usually the taking
    of the oath is a private affair between the neophyte and the
    Clerk, and the House hears nothing more than a confused murmur
    before the ceremony is concluded by the new Member kissing the
    Book or&mdash;more often in these days&mdash;adopting the
    Scottish fashion of holding up the right hand. Oxford's elect
    would have none of this. Like the Highland chieftain, "she just
    stude in the middle of ta fluir and swoor at lairge." Not since
    Mr. BRADLAUGH insisted upon administering the oath to himself
    has the House been so much stirred; even Members loitering in
    the Lobby could almost have heard the ringing tones in which
    Mr. MARRIOTT proclaimed his allegiance to our Sovereign Lord,
    KING GEORGE THE FIFTH.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, April 3rd</i>.&mdash;Mr. KING really displays a
    good deal of ingenuity in his endeavours to get men out of the
    Army. His latest notion is that all Commanding Officers at home
    should be ordered to give leave to those men who have gardens
    so that they may return to cultivate them. There would, no
    doubt, be a remarkable development of horticultural enthusiasm
    among our home forces if the War Office were to smile upon the
    idea; but, though fully alive to the value of food-production,
    the UNDER-SECRETARY was unable to assent to this wide extension
    of "agricultural furlough."</p>

    <p>A request by the Press Bureau that newspapers would submit
    for its approval any articles dealing with disputes in the
    coal-trade gave umbrage to several Members, who saw in it an
    attempt by the Government to fetter public criticism. Mr. BRACE
    mildly explained that the object was only to prevent the
    appearance of inaccurate statements likely to cause friction in
    an inflammable trade. When Mr. KING still protested, Mr. BRACE
    again showed that his velvet paw conceals a very serviceable
    weapon. "Surely the Honourable Member does not believe that
    inaccurate statements can ever be helpful." Then there was
    silence.</p>

    <p>Mr. BONAR LAW stoutly denied that the National Service
    scheme was a failure, but admitted that the Cabinet was looking
    into it with a view to its improvement. Up to the present some
    220,000 men have volunteered, but as about half of these are
    already engaged on work of national importance Mr. NEVILLE
    CHAMBERLAIN is still a long way short of his hoped-for
    half-a-million <span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"
       id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span> ready, like the British
       Army, to go anywhere and do anything.</p>

    <p>A telegram from the British Ambassador at Washington,
    stating that President WILSON'S War-speech had been very well
    received, and that Congress was expected to take his advice,
    gave great satisfaction. As the MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE
    observed, "The outlook for early potatoes may be doubtful, but
    our SPRING-RICE promises excellently."</p>

    <p>Mr. PROTHERO has made up his alleged differences with the
    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR, and signalized the treaty of peace
    first by snuggling up to Mr. MACPHERSON on the Treasury Bench,
    and next by handsomely supporting the new Military Service
    Bill. In return the UNDER-SECRETARY FOR WAR introduced a
    much-needed amendment by which men wholly engaged on
    food-production may be exempted by the Board of Agriculture
    from the process of "re-combing" now to be applied to the rest
    of the population.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 4th.</i>&mdash;Mr. SNOWDEN disapproves
    of the selection of the two Labour Members who are to form part
    of a deputation about to proceed to Petrograd to convey to the
    Russian Government the congratulations of the British people.
    Possibly the neckties of the proposed envoys are not of a
    sufficiently sanguinary shade, or their brows are not lofty
    enough to proclaim them true "leaders of thought." The
    suggestion that the Member for Blackburn should himself be
    despatched to Petrograd (without a return ticket) has been
    regretfully abandoned.</p>

    <h2>THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND.</h2>

    <p>In the course of a recent search for Italian conversation
    manuals I came upon one which put so strangely novel a
    complexion on our own tongue that, though it was not quite what
    I was seeking, I bought it. To see ourselves as others see us
    may be a difficult operation, but to hear ourselves as others
    hear us is by this little book made quite easy. Everyone knows
    the old story of the Italian who entered an East-bound omnibus
    in the Strand and asked to be put down at Kay-ahp-see-day.
    Well, this book should prevent him from doing it again.</p>

    <p>But its great attraction is the courageous personality of
    the protagonist as revealed by his various remarks. For
    example, most of us who are not linguists confine our
    conversations in foreign places to the necessities of life,
    rarely leaving the beaten track of bread and butter, knives and
    forks, the times of trains, cab fares, the way to the station,
    the way to the post-office, hotel prices and washing lists. And
    even then we disdain or flee from syntax. But this
    conversationalist embroiders and dilates. He is intrepid. He
    has no reluctances. Where we in Italy would, at the most, say
    to the <i>cameriere</i>, "<i>Portaci una tazza di
    caff&egrave;</i>," and think ourselves lucky to get it, he
    lures the London waiter to invite a disquistion on the precious
    berry. Thus, he begins: "<i>C&ograve;ffi is
    r</i><b>i</b>-<i>march&ecirc;bl f&ograve;r i</i><b>z</b>
    <i>v&egrave;r</i><b>e</b> <i>stim-i&ugrave;l&ecirc;tin
    pr&ograve;p&egrave;</i><b>r</b><i>t</i><b>&ecirc;</b>. <i>Du ju
    n&ocirc; hau it u&ograve;s
    disc&ograve;vva</i><b>r</b><i>d?</i>" The waiter very promptly
    and properly saying, "<i>N&ocirc;, S&ocirc;r</i>," the Italian
    unloads as follows: "<i>U&egrave;l, ai uil t&egrave;l ju
    th&egrave;t i</i><b>z</b> <i>disc&ograve;vvar&ecirc; is
    s&ecirc;d tu h&egrave;v bin &ograve;ch&ecirc;sci&ograve;nt bai

    appr&egrave;sci&ecirc;sci&ograve;n &ograve;v i</i><b>z</b>
    <i>valli&ugrave;.</i>"</p>

    <p>A little later a London bookseller has the temerity to place
    some of the latest fiction before our chatty alien, but pays
    dearly for his rash act. In these words did the Italian let him
    have it:&mdash;"<i>Ai du n&ograve;t laich n&ograve;v-&egrave;ls
    &egrave;t &ograve;l, bic&ocirc;</i>-<b>s</b> <i>&ecirc;
    n&ograve;v-&egrave;l is b&agrave;t &ecirc; fichtisci&ograve;s

    <i>pr&ecirc;-sci&ograve;s taim in ridin n&ograve;v-&egrave;ls!
    Th&ecirc; du n&ograve;t n&ocirc; th&egrave;t

    u&ecirc;st&egrave;d &egrave;nd u&ecirc;st
    th&egrave;a</i><b>r</b> <i>laif in
    li&ugrave;dn&egrave;s.</i>"</p>

    <p>English people abroad do not, as a rule, drop aphorisms by
    the way; but our Italian loves to do so. Thus, to one stranger
    (in the section devoted to Virtues and Vices), he remarks,
    "<i>Uith-aut Riligi&ograve;n ui sci&ugrave;d bi
    u&ograve;r</i><b>s</b> <i>th&egrave;n b&icirc;sts.</i>" To
    another, "<i>Thi igotist sp&icirc;chs
    c&ograve;ntinni&ugrave;all</i><b>e</b> <i>&ograve;v himself
    &egrave;nd m&ecirc;chs hims&egrave;lf thi
    s&egrave;nta</i><b>r</b> <i>&ograve;v
    &egrave;vv&egrave;r</i><b>e</b> <i>thingh.</i>" And to a third,
    a little tactlessly perhaps, "<i>Imp&oacute;lait-n&egrave;s is
    disg&ograve;stin.</i>" He is sententious even to his hatter:
    "<i>&Ecirc; h&egrave;t sci&ugrave;d bi
    pr&ocirc;p&ocirc;rsci&ograve;n</i><b>d</b> <i>tu thi h&egrave;d
    &egrave;nd p&egrave;rs&ograve;n, f&ograve;r it is
    l&acirc;f-&egrave;bl tu s&icirc; &ecirc; la</i><b>r</b><i>gg
    h&egrave;t &ograve;p-&ograve;n &ecirc; sm&ograve;l h&egrave;d,
    &egrave;nd &ecirc; sm&ograve;l h&egrave;t &ograve;p-&ograve;n
    &ecirc; la</i><b>r</b><i>gg h&egrave;d.</i>" But sometimes he
    goes all astray. He is, for instance, desperately ill-informed
    as to English law. In England, he tells us, and believes the
    pathetic fallacy, "<i>thi tr&ecirc;ns st&agrave;rt &egrave;nd
    arraiv v&egrave;r</i><b>e</b>
    <i>p&ograve;ngh-ci&ugrave;</i><b>a</b><i>ll</i><b>e</b>,
    <i>&ograve;tha</i><b>r</b>-<i>uais
    pass&egrave;n-gi&agrave;</i><b>r</b><i>s hu arraiv-l&ecirc;t
    f&ograve;r th&egrave;a</i><b>r</b> <i>bis-n&egrave;s cud
    si&ugrave; thi Comp</i><b>a</b><i>n</i><b>e</b> <i>f&ocirc;r
    d&egrave;m-&ecirc;gg</i>-<b>s</b>."</p>

    <p>He is calm and collected in an emergency. Thus, to a lady
    who has burst into flames, "<i>Bi not &ecirc;fr&ecirc;d,
    Madam</i>," he says, "<i>thi fai</i><b>r</b> <i>h&egrave;s
    c&ograve;t jur gaun. L&eacute; daun &ograve;p-&ograve;n thi
    fl&ograve;</i><b>r</b>, <i>&egrave;nd ju uil put aut thi
    fai</i><b>r</b> <i>uith jur h&egrave;nd</i><b>s</b>." His
    presence of mind saves him from using his own hands for the
    purpose. Resourcefulness is indeed as natural to him as to Sir
    CHRISTOPHER WREN in the famous poem. "<i>Uilliam,</i>" he says
    to his man, "<i>if
    &egrave;n</i><b>e</b><i>b&ograve;d</i><b>e</b> <i>asch-s
    f&ograve;r mi, ju uil s&ecirc; th&egrave;t ai sc&egrave;l bi
    b&egrave;ch in &ecirc; f&ograve;rt-nait.</i>"</p>

    <p>He meets Miss Butterfield.</p>

    <p>"<i>Mis B&ograve;tta</i><b>r</b><i>fild</i>," he says,
    "<i>uil ju ghiv mi &ecirc; gl&agrave;s &ograve;v
    u&ograve;ta</i><b>r</b>, <i>if ju
    pl&icirc;</i><b>s</b><i>?</i>" And that is the end of the lady.
    Or I think so. But there is just a possibility that it is she
    (no longer Miss Butterfield, but now a Signora) whom he rebukes
    in a coffee-house: "<i>Mai dia</i><b>r</b>, <i>du n&ograve;t
    sp&iacute;ch &ograve;v p&ograve;llitichs in &ecirc;
    C&ograve;ffi-Haus, f&ograve;r n&ograve;
    travv</i><b>e</b><i>lla</i><b>r</b>, <i>if
    pri&ugrave;d&egrave;nt, &egrave;vva</i><b>r</b> <i>t&ograve;chs
    &egrave;baut p&ograve;llitichs in p&ograve;blich.</i>" And
    again it may be for Miss Butterfield that he orders a charming
    present (first saying it is for a lady): "<i>Ghiv mi
    th&egrave;t ripitta</i><b>r</b> <i>s&egrave;t uith
    rub&egrave;s, th&egrave;t straich</i>-<b>s</b> <i>thi
    aur</i><b>s</b> <i>&egrave;nd thi
    h&acirc;f-aur</i><b>s</b>."</p>

    <p>Finally he embarks for Australia and quickly becomes as
    human as the rest of us. "<i>Thi uind,</i>" he murmurs
    uneasily, "<i>is raisin. Thi si is v&egrave;r</i><b>e</b>
    <i>r&ograve;f. Thi m&ocirc;-sci&ograve;n &ograve;v thi
    Stim-b&ocirc;t m&ecirc;ch</i>-<b>s</b> <i>mi an-u&egrave;l. Ai

    di</i><b>zze</b>. <i>Ai h&egrave;v g&ograve;t &ecirc;
    h&egrave;d-&ecirc;ch.</i>" But he assures a fellow-passenger
    that there is no cause for fear, even if a storm should come
    on. "<i>Du n&ograve;t bi
    &agrave;la</i><b>r</b><i>m</i><b>d</b>," he says;
    "<i>th&egrave;a</i><b>r</b> <i>is n&ocirc;
    d&ecirc;ngg-a</i><b>r</b>. <i>Thi Ch&egrave;p-t&egrave;n
    &ograve;v this Stima</i>-<b>r</b> <i>is &egrave;
    v&egrave;r</i><b>e</b> <i>cl&egrave;va</i><b>r</b>
    <i>m&egrave;n."</i></p>

    <p>His last words, addressed apparently to the rest of the
    passengers as they reach Adelaide, are these: "<i>L&egrave;t
    &ograve;s m&ecirc;ch h&ecirc;st &egrave;nd g&ocirc; tu thi
    C&ograve;st&ograve;m-Hau</i><b>s</b> <i>tu h&egrave;v aur

    <h2>EMERGENCY RATIONS.</h2>

    <p>In our village many disruptions have been wrought by the
    War, but nothing has ever approached the state of turveydom
    which came in with the system of daily rations.</p>

    <p>Margery brought home the first news of the revolution.</p>

    <p>"Most extraordinary thing," she said. "The Joneses have got
    the two old Miss Singleweeds staying with them."</p>

    <p>"What!" I exclaimed, swallowing my ration of mammalia in one
    astonished gulp. "Why, only two or three days ago Jones told me
    very privately that the Singleweeds were two of the most
    interfering, bigoted, cabbage-eating
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
       id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> old cats that he had ever
       come across."</p>

    <p>"Cabbage-eating!" repeated Margery thoughtfully. "How stupid
    we are. That's it, of course."</p>

    <p>"What's it?"</p>

    <p>"Why, cabbage-eating. The Singleweeds haven't touched meat
    since I don't know when, so for a consideration of
    brussels-sprouts and a few digestive biscuits the Joneses will
    have five pounds of genuine beef to play with."</p>

    <p>"Hogs!" I said.</p>

    <p>The hospitable influence of the new scheme of rationing
    spread very rapidly. A few days later we heard that Sir Meesly
    Goormay, the most self-indulgent and incorrigible egotist in
    the neighbourhood, had introduced a collection of octogenarian
    aunts to his household, and, when I was performing my afternoon
    beat, I was just in time to see the butcher's boy, assisted by
    the gardener, delivering what looked to be a baron of beef at
    Sir Meesly's back door. It was an enervating and disgusting
    spectacle, well calculated to upset the <i>moral</i> of the
    steadiest special in the local force.</p>

    <p>That night at dinner I had a Machiavellian thought.</p>

    <p>"Look here," I said, stabbing at a plate of <i>petit
    pois</i> (1911) and mis-cueing badly, "what about having Uncle
    Tom to stay for a few weeks?"</p>

    <p>"Last time he came," replied Margery, "you said that nothing
    would induce you to ask him again. You haven't forgotten his
    chronic dyspepsia, have you?"</p>

    <p>"Of course not," I retorted, looking a little pained at such
    flagrant gaucherie; "but you can't cast off a respectable blood
    relation because he happens to live on charcoal and hot
    water."</p>

    <p>I delivered an irritable attack on a lentil pudding.</p>

    <p>"Right-O," agreed Marjory. "And I'll ask Joan as well. She
    won't be able to come until Friday, because she's having some
    teeth extracted on Thursday."</p>

    <p>After all Marjory is not altogether without perception.</p>

    <p>Dinner over I wrote, in my best style, a short spontaneous
    invitation to Uncle Tom. Margery wrote a more discursive one to
    Joan.</p>

    <p>"I think we ought to celebrate this," I suggested. "Let's be
    extravagant."</p>

    <p>"All right," said Margery. "What shall it be, champagne or
    potatoes?"</p>

    <p>Two days later I received the following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"MY DEAR JAMES,&mdash;Thank you very much for your
    invitation, which I am very pleased to accept. The country,
    after all, is the proper place for old fogeys like myself, as
    it is very difficult for them to live up to the present-day
    bustle of a large city. For the last six months I have been
    doing odd jobs at a munition factory, which, I must admit, has
    benefited my health in an extraordinary manner, so much so that
    I have entirely lost the troublesome dyspepsia I suffered from,
    and now, you will be glad to hear, I am able to eat like a
    hunter, as we used to say. Hoping to find you all flourishing
    on Thursday next, about lunch-time,</p>

    <p class="center">"Your affectionate<br />
    UNCLE TOM."</p>

    <p>Instinctively I took my belt in a hole. Then Margery
    silently placed this in front of me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"DARLING MARGERY,&mdash;How perfectly sweet of you! I shall
    simply love it. I am feeling especially beany as I have just
    finished with the dentist&mdash;usually a hateful
    person&mdash;who found out, after all, that it was not
    necessary to take out any of my teeth. I adore him. No time for
    more. Heaps to tell you on Friday,</p>

    <p class="center">"Your loving<br />
    J.J."</p>

    <p>"Hullo! Where are you off to?" I asked, as Margery made for
    the door.</p>

    <p>"Off to? Why, to put our names down on the Singleweeds'
    waiting list."</p>

    <p>I took my belt up another hole and, whistling <i>The Bing
    Boys</i> out of sheer desperate bravado, made my gloomy way to
    the potato patch.</p>

    <h2>GERMAN MEASLES.</h2>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "you must admit that at last I have you
    at a disadvantage."</p>

    <p>"I admit nothing of the sort."</p>

    <p>"Well," I said, "have you or have you not got German
    measles? It seems almost an insult to put such a question to a
    woman of your energy and brilliant intellectual capacity, but
    you force me to it."</p>

    <p>"Dr. Manley&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Come, come, don't fob it off on the Doctor. He didn't
    wilfully provide you with an absurd attack of this childish
    disease."</p>

    <p>"No, he didn't; but when I was getting along quite nicely
    with the idea that I was suffering from a passing headache he
    butted in and sent me to bed as a German measler&mdash;and now
    we've all got it."</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "you've all got it, all my little chickens
    and their dam&mdash;you're the dam, remember that,
    Francesca&mdash;Muriel's got it, Nina's got it, Alice has got
    it and Frederick has got it very slightly, but he insists on
    having all the privileges of the worst kind of invalid; and
    you've got it, Francesca, and I'm left scatheless in a position
    of unlimited power and no responsibility."</p>

    <p>"Yes," she said, "it's terrible, but you will use your
    strength mercifully."</p>

    <p>"I'm not at all sure about that. At first I felt like one of
    those old prisoner Johnnies&mdash;Baron TRENCK, you know, or
    LATUDE&mdash;who were all shaky and mild when they were at last
    released; but now I've had time to think&mdash;yes, I've had
    time to think."</p>

    <p>"And what is the result of your thoughts?"</p>

    <p>"The result," I said, "is that I'm determined to do things
    thoroughly. I've mastered all your jealously-guarded secrets
    and I've allowed the strong wind of a man's intellect to blow
    through them. I am facing the cook on a new system and am
    dealing with the tradesmen in a spirit of inexorable
    resolution. The housemaid is being brought to heel and has
    already begun not to leave her brushes and dust-pans lying
    about on the floors of the library and the drawing-room. Stern
    measures are being taken with the kitchen-maid; and Parkins,
    that ancient servitor, is slowly being reduced to obedience.
    Even the garden is feeling the new influence and potatoes are
    being planted where no potatoes were ever planted before.
    Everything, in fact, is being reformed."</p>

    <p>"I warn you," said Francesca, "that your reforms will not be
    allowed to go on. As soon as I can get rid of the German
    measles I shall restore everything to its former
    condition."</p>

    <p>"But that," I said, "is the counter-revolution."</p>

    <p>"It is; and it's going to begin as soon as I get out of
    bed."</p>

    <p>"And what are you going to bring out of bed with you?"</p>

    <p>"Common sense," said Francesca.</p>

    <p>"Not at all," I said. "You're going to bring out of bed with
    you that hard reactionary bureaucratic spirit which all but
    ruined Russia and is in process of ruining Germany. It will be
    just as if the TSARITSA got loose and began to have her own way
    again. By the way, Francesca, what does one do when the butcher
    says there won't be any haunch of mutton till Tuesday, or when
    the grocer refuses you your due amount of sugar?"</p>

    <p>"A TSARITSA," said Francesca haughtily, "cannot concern
    herself with sugar or haunches of mutton."</p>

    <p>"But suppose that the TSARITSA has got German measles.
    Couldn't she manage to beat up an interest in mundane
    affairs?"</p>

    <p>"I'll tell you what," said Francesca.</p>

    <p>"Do," I said; "I'm dying to hear it."</p>

    <p>"Well, you'd better let the strong wind of a man's intellect
    blow through them."</p>

    <p>"What," I said&mdash;"through the haunch of mutton?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, you could do without the haunch, you know, and score
    off the butcher."</p>

    <p>"That's a sound idea. You're not so badly measled as I
    thought you were."</p>

    <p>"Oh," she said, "I shall soon be rid of them
    altogether."</p>

    <p>"To tell you the truth, I wish you'd hurry up."</p>

    <p>"Long live the counter-revolution!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, as long as you like," I said.</p>

    <p>"Have you given the children their medicine and taken their
    temperatures?"</p>

    <p>"I'm just off to do it," I said.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks.</i>)</p>

    <p>I am wondering whether, among the myriad by-products of the
    War, there should be numbered a certain note of virility
    hitherto (if he will forgive me for saying so) foreign to the
    literary style of Mr. E. TEMPLE THURSTON. Because I have
    certainly found <i>Enchantment</i> (UNWIN) a far more vigorous
    and less saccharine affair than previous experience had led me
    to expect from him. For which reason I find it far and away my
    favourite of the stories by this author that I have so far
    encountered. I certainly think (for example) that not one of
    his Cities of Beautiful Barley-Sugar contains any figures so
    alive as those of <i>John Desmond</i>, the hard-drinking Irish
    squireen, and <i>Mrs. Slattery</i>, his adoring housekeeper.
    There is red blood in both, and not less in <i>Charles
    Stuart</i>, a hero whose earlier adventures with smugglers,
    secret passages and the like have an almost STEVENSONIAN
    vigour. All the life of impoverished Waterpark, with its
    wonderful drawing-room full of precarious furniture, is
    excellently drawn. I willingly allow Mr. THURSTON so much of
    his earlier manner as is implied in the (quite pleasant)
    conceit of the fairy-tale. The point is that the real tale here
    is neither of fairies nor of sugar dolls, but of genuine human
    beings, vastly entertaining to read about and quite
    convincingly credible. I can only entreat the author to
    continue this rationing of sentiment for our mutual
    benefit.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When a book rejoices in such a title as <i>The Amazing
    Years</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) and begins with a prosperous
    English family contemplating their summer holiday in August
    1914, you may be tolerably certain beforehand of its
    subject-matter. When, moreover, the name on the title-page is
    that of Mr. W. PETT RIDGE, you may with equal security
    anticipate that, whatever troubles befall this English family
    by the way, they will eventually reach a happy ending, and find
    all for the best in the best of all genially humorous worlds.
    As indeed it proves. But of course the <i>Hilliers</i> were
    exceptionally fortunate in the fact that when the crash came
    they had one of those quite invaluable super-domestics whom Mr.
    PETT RIDGE delights in to steer them back to prosperity. The
    story tells us how the KAISER compelled the <i>Hilliers</i> to
    leave "The Croft," and how that very capable woman, <i>Miss
    Weston</i>, restored it to them again, chiefly by the aid of
    her antique shop; and to anyone who has recently been a
    customer in such an establishment this result fully explains
    itself. I need not further enlarge upon the theme of the book.
    Your previous knowledge of Mr. PETT RIDGE'S method will enable
    you to imagine how the various members of the <i>Hillier</i>
    household confront the changes brought by The Amazing Years;
    but this will not make you less anxious to read it for yourself
    in the author's own inimitable telling. I won't call this his
    best novel; now and again, indeed, there seemed rather too much
    padding for so slender a plot; but, take it for all in all, and
    bearing in mind the strange fact that we all love to read about
    events with which we are already familiar, I can at least
    promise you a cheery and optimistic entertainment.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Jan Ross</i>, grey-haired at twenty-seven, but sweet of
    face and of a most taking way, found herself unexpectedly
    confronted, a year or two ago, with a "job." It was eventually
    to include the looking after a certain <i>Peter</i>, of the
    Indian Civil Service, a thoroughly good sort, who by now is
    making <span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"
       id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span> her as happy as she
       deserves; but in the first place it meant the care of a
       little motherless niece and nephew and their protection from
       a scoundrelly father. How successfully she has been doing it
       and what charmingly human babies are her charges,
       <i>Tony</i> and <i>Fay</i>, you will realise when I say that
       it is Mrs. L. ALLEN HARKER who has been telling me all about
       <i>Jan and Her Job</i> (MURRAY). You will understand, too,
       how pleasantly peaceful, how utterly removed from the
       artificially forced crispness of the special correspondent,
       is the telling of the story; but you must read it yourself
       to learn how simply and naturally the writer has used the
       coming of the War for her last chapter, and above all to get
       to know not only <i>Jan</i> herself but also that most loyal
       of comrades, her pal <i>Meg</i>. <i>Meg</i>, indeed, is
       almost as much in the middle of the stage as the friend
       whose nursemaid she has elected to become; and as the
       completion of her own private happiness has to remain in
       doubt until the coming of peace, since Mrs. HARKER has
       resolutely refused to guarantee the survival of the
       soldier-sweetheart, you must join me in wishing him the best
       of good fortune. He is still rubbing it into the Bosches.
       Perhaps some day the author will be able to reassure us.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When I have said that <i>Twentieth-Century France</i>
    (CHAPMAN AND HALL) is rather over-weighted by its title my
    grumble is made. To deal adequately with twentieth-century
    France in a volume of little more than two hundred
    amply-margined pages is beyond the powers of Miss M.
    BETHAM-EDWARDS or of any other writer. But, under any title,
    whatever she writes about France must be worth reading, and
    to-day of all times the French need to be explained to us
    almost as much as we need to be explained to them. Miss
    BETHAM-EDWARDS can be trusted to do this good work with
    admirable sympathy and discretion. Here she writes intimately
    of many people whose names are already household words in
    France. The more books we have of the kind the better.
    VOLTAIRE, we are reminded, once said that "when a Frenchman and
    an Englishman agree upon any subject we may be quite sure they
    have reason on their side." Well, they are agreeing at present
    upon a certain subject with what the Huns must regard as
    considerable unanimity. If in the last century there was any
    misunderstanding between us and our neighbours it is now in a
    fair way to be removed to the back of beyond; and in this
    removal Miss EDWARDS has lent a very helping hand.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>What chiefly impressed me about <i>Marshdikes</i> (UNWIN)
    was what I can only call the blazing indiscretion of the chief
    characters. To begin with, you have a happily married young
    couple asking a nice man down for the week-end to meet a girl,
    and as good as telling him that the party has been arranged, as
    the advertisements put it, with a view to matrimony. Passing
    from this, we find a doctor (surely unique) blurting out to a
    fellow-guest at dinner that a mutual friend had consulted him
    for heart trouble. To crown all, when the match arranged by the
    young couple has got as far as an engagement, the wife must
    needs go and tell the girl that the whole affair was
    man&oelig;uvred by herself. Which naturally upset that
    apple-cart. It had also the effect of making me a somewhat
    impatient spectator of the subsequent developments, mainly
    political, of the plot. I smiled, though, when the hero was
    worsted in his by-election. After all, with a set of supporters
    so destitute of elementary tact.... But, of course, I know
    quite well what is my real grievance. Miss HELEN ASHTON began
    her story with a chapter so full of sparkle that I am peevish
    at being disappointed of the comedy that this promised. Perhaps
    next time she will take the hint, and give us an entire novel
    in the key which, I am sure, suits her best.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>A Little World Apart</i> (LANE) is one of those gentle
    stories that please as much by reminding you of others like
    them as by any qualities of their own. Indeed you might call
    it, with no disparagement intended, a fragrant pot-pourri of
    many rustic romances&mdash;<i>Our Village</i>, for example, and
    more than a touch of <i>Cranford</i>. Your literary memory may
    also suggest to you another scene in fiction almost startlingly
    like the one here, in which the gently-born lover (named
    <i>Arthur</i>) of the village beauty is forced to combat by her
    rustic suitor. Fortunately, however, Mr. GEORGE STEVENSON has
    no tragedy like that of <i>Hetty</i> in store for his
    <i>Rose</i>. His picture of rural life is more mellow than
    melodramatic; and his tale reaches a happy end, unchequered by
    anything more sensational than a mild outbreak of scandal from
    the local wag-tongues. There are many pleasant, if rather
    familiar, characters; though I own to a certain sense of
    repletion arising from the elderly and domineering dowagers of
    fiction, of whom <i>Lady Crane</i> may be regarded as embodying
    the common form. <i>A Little World Apart</i>, in short, is no
    very sensational discovery, but good enough as a quiet corner
    for repose.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
